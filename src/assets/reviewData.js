      'The owner, Joanne, did most of the work herself and accommodated the cleaning on short notice. She did a super, incredible job deep cleaning the house that was lived-in for 40+ years. It truly shines now and is ready for a buyer. We and our realtor were extremely pleased with her work and results',

      'It went great! 2 girls came on time and cleaned for 3.5 hours. I have 2 cats and a dog so I was just amazed with how clean it was afterward! The cleaners were super nice and friendly, professional, and did a really good job. My house looks awesome for our open house coming up, highly recommend.',

      "Joanne and her team are amazing! We've been using them for about 10 months and I am so happy with the job that they do. I am pretty picky and I rarely find things they miss (and they are always minor things). We have them do the regular cleaning every two weeks. Joanne isn't always here but if she's not she usually follows up to make sure I am satisfied with the job done. She also periodically asks if I'm happy with the work that they are doing and if there is anything they can do better. Joanne is so personable and the ladies she hires are as well. I have also had them help me out with a few extras, like of oven cleaning and kitchen cabinet cleaning. I have always been satisfied with that work as well. Joanne is very competitively priced. And she's definitely cheaper than the chains and so much better. If I could give her an A+ I would!",

      "What I like most about A Clean Getaway is they don't have a set cleaning schedule for your home, meaning you can let them know each time they come, what you would like cleaned. For instance, I always have my master bathroom fully cleaned, however there are times where I don't need my guest bathroom showers cleaned as they haven't been used since the last time they were cleaned, etc- I simply make a list each time of things I would like done, and then they are able to complete those for me. Sometimes I have my stovetop and applicances cleaned, othertimes I have them dust my baseboards, etc. There is lots of flexibility and I love that.",

      "The owner, Joanne Jess, came in to examine the house and make the bid.  She stopped by within hours of my email requesting a bid.  It is a very large house (nearly 6,000 square feet) which includes a home business, making it a real bear to bid and clean.  She took time to think about it and made a bid for the deep cleaning.  We decided to do that first, so that she could get a sense of the time it would take on a bi-weekly basis, before agreeing to the price for a regular cleaning.  I loved the deep clean so much, I wanted her to perform a few extras once a month to keep that 'deep clean' feeling.  She has been doing the bi-weekly cleaning since mid April and I couldn't be happier.  While she charges more than my last cleaners, the price is well worth the value I receive from the sort of clean my great-grandmother would do, you could eat off her floors.",

      'Joanne has great communication, we met to verify estimate and she was close to the amount originally quoted.  She was prompt for meeting me for estimate. Did the work in a timely manner and the bathroom and kitchen looked great.  She even did an estimate for another place I have and was honest and up front on what the costs would be.  I would highly recommend her.',

      "They clean better than anyone I've ever had so far. I am on a septic system, and they only use water to clean with, so I think that's healthier for my septic system. The floors just sparkle when she leaves, so I'm real happy with her. I think her services are just fantastic. I have had other housecleaners and never had anyone consistently keep my house as clean as she does. She is very friendly and professional. She is very responsive. If I ever want anything different, then she is very good about it. She calls if she's going to be a little late.",

When I need something special done, we discuss it, and she always asks questions to make sure she knows what needs to be done and exactly how I want it to be done.  I am so lucky she cleans for me! :)',
